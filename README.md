<h1>Optimal Economic Load Dispatch (ELD) Iterative Algorithm ⚡️</h1>

<p>
Economic Load Dispatch (ELD) focuses on distributing power generation across multiple plants 
to meet electricity demand at the lowest cost while respecting operational limits. 
It's a critical problem in power systems, ensuring both efficiency and reliability.
</p>

<h2>The Idea Behind This Project 🧠</h2>
<p>
This MATLAB program automates the tedious process of manual ELD calculations by using an 
iterative optimization algorithm. It dynamically adjusts power outputs step-by-step to 
achieve optimal results, always respecting generator constraints. The program is scalable 
and robust, capable of handling small setups and large, complex systems seamlessly.
</p>

<h2>Why This Matters 💪</h2>
<ul>
<li>Reduces human errors by automating precise, optimal power distribution.</li>
<li>Handles models from 3 to 10+ generators effectively, maintaining high accuracy and scalability.</li>
<li>Adapts reliably to constraint violations, ensuring feasible and realistic solutions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What’s Next? 🚀</h2>
<p>
Future enhancements will incorporate real-world complexities like transmission losses and penalty factors. 
With these improvements, the algorithm can adapt to dynamic loads and renewable energy integration, 
making it a versatile tool for modern power grids.
